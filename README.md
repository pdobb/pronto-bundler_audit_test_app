# README

This is a simple rails app whose only purpose is for testing [pronto-bundler_audit](https://github.com/pdobb/pronto-bundler_audit)'s GitHub integration.

Note to self:
When testing gem vulnerabilities, it is important to test not only PRs with Gemfile.lock changes, but also PRs without Gemfile.lock changes.
